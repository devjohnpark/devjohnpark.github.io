      Get up and running with ðŸ¤— Transformer\'s! Trans_ Whether youâ€™re a developer or an *everyday user*, this quick tour **will help you** get started and show you how to use the :ref:`pipelines  <pipelines>` ()   for inference, 

         "load a pretrained model and preprocessor with an AutoClass, and quickly train a model"
         -- with PyTorch or TensorFlow.

1. Use a pipeline() for inference.

2. Use a specific tokenizer or model.
3. Use a pipeline() for audio, vision, and multimodal tasks.



AutoProcessor 
   Multimodal tasks require a processor that combines two types of preprocessing tools. For example, the

AutoModel
   nally, the AutoModelFor classes let you load a pretrained model for a given task (see here for a complete list of available tasks). For example, load a model for sequence classification with
